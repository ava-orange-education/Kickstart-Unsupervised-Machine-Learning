## Kickstart Unsupervised Machine Learning

This is the repository for [Kickstart Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://orangeava.com/products/kickstart-unsupervised-machine-learning), published by Orange AVA™

## About the Book
Unsupervised machine learning is revolutionizing how organizations extract value from raw data, revealing patterns and structures without predefined labels. From customer segmentation and fraud detection to generative modeling, its versatility drives innovation across industries.

Kickstart Unsupervised Machine Learning is your comprehensive companion to mastering this transformative field. Starting with the core principles, the book introduces essential clustering algorithms—including K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical approaches—before advancing to dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for simplifying complex data. It then explores sophisticated models like Gaussian Mixture Models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), combining theory with practical coding exercises and hands-on projects using real-world datasets to solidify your understanding.

Thus, by the end of this book, you will confidently evaluate, deploy, and optimize unsupervised models to derive meaningful insights from unstructured data.
